# 🧩 All-in-One Frontend

The **All-in-One Frontend** is a **Micro Frontend** architecture-based solution for the **Business Aggregator Platform**. It provides a modular, scalable, and adaptable experience, allowing businesses to access tailored modules within a unified user interface.

## 🌐 Why Micro Frontends?

Micro Frontends break down a large monolithic frontend into **independent, modular applications**. This approach benefits the **Business Aggregator Platform** by offering:

- **Scalability**: Add or update features without impacting the entire system.
- **Modular Flexibility**: Each business type can access specific, dynamically loaded modules.
- **Independent Deployment**: Develop, test, and deploy each module separately.
- **Improved Collaboration**: Teams can work on different micro frontends simultaneously.
- **Custom User Experience**: Each business sees only the features relevant to them.

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Business Registration**: Super Admin registers a business and assigns modules.
2. **Dynamic Module Loading**: Only required modules are loaded for each business type.
3. **User Interaction**: Users experience a unified dashboard while each business type operates with its unique logic.
